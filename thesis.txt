ABSTRACT

With the rapid growth of urbanization and mobile technologies, understanding and predicting human mobility patterns has become an important research area in data analysis and artificial intelligence. Accurate mobility prediction can help in improving transportation systems, urban planning, traffic management, and location-based services. This project focuses on developing an AI-based mobility analysis system that studies user movement patterns and predicts future locations using historical check-in data.

In this work, large-scale location-based datasets are collected and preprocessed to remove inconsistencies and noise. The cleaned data is then analyzed to identify frequent movement patterns and user behavior. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based deep learning model is implemented to capture temporal and spatial dependencies in mobility sequences. The model learns from past user trajectories and predicts the next possible location with improved accuracy.

Various data analysis techniques such as statistical analysis, visualization, and mapping are used to understand mobility trends. Geographic coordinates are mapped to real-world locations for better interpretation of results. The proposed system is trained and evaluated on real-world datasets, and its performance is measured using suitable evaluation metrics.

The developed system provides valuable insights into human movement behavior and can be applied in smart city planning, route recommendation, traffic optimization, and personalized location-based services. This project demonstrates the effective use of artificial intelligence and data analytics in solving real-world mobility-related problems and highlights future opportunities for enhancing predictive accuracy using advanced deep learning models and real-time data.
